Before its invention, barter required a coincidence of desires, limiting exchanges to local and inefficient interactions. As Yuval Noah Harari emphasized (Sapiens, 2014), money is a shared fiction, a collective act of faith that transcends cultural and geographical barriers, enabling trade, investment, and the building of complex societies. Without it, humanity would be relegated to economic chaos, unable to coordinate ambitions or sustain large-scale development.</p> <p>In terms of followers, money is essentially an act of faith whose \u201creligion\u201d embraces nearly all of humanity. It eclipses all past religions or ideologies.  </p> <p>Surnumerism, synonymous with surplus, follows this lineage by supporting human labor through a specific levy on large corporations for the benefit of senior executives, fostering entrepreneurial continuity. The term \u201csurplus\u201d evokes potential unlocked through intelligent redistribution.

It embodies collective trust in a shared value, allowing individuals to collaborate without knowing each other. According to Niall Ferguson (The Ascent of Money, 2008), the rise of money multiplied economic interactions, transforming isolated communities into global networks. However, this human creation has been diverted: speculative finance, with a derivatives market estimated at 600 trillion USD (Bank for International Settlements, 2025), channels flows away from productive purposes, deepening inequalities (1% holds 54% of global wealth, Oxfam, 2025). Technological unemployment, threatening 20% of jobs by 2030 (OECD), exacerbates this divide.</p> <p>Surnumerism rehabilitates human labor. By levying a CapitalSurn on large corporations (revenues &gt;1 billion USD or &gt;500 employees), it channels wealth toward deserving senior executives, who reinvest in high-value projects (SROI &gt;1.5).

For a senior executive who, after one or two decades serving a company, faces the problem of longevity: - During the time spent at the company, the latter has accumulated sums that are out of all proportion to the meager retirement pension reserved for the executive. - This executive is an invaluable resource who, instead of flourishing and developing his own company and thereby recruiting other executives and subordinates, finds himself and his family in precariousness. His children must restart the cycle from zero instead of building upon what their father initiated. The torch is too often extinguished. - Therefore, a race against time is imposed upon us if we want a respectable proportion of executives to become entrepreneurial promoters.</p> <p>An institutionalization of a specific economic system must be established in minds, then in customs.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/#the-remuneration-of-work","title":"The Remuneration of Work","text":"<p>Work that truly carries value must be rewarded beyond salary, which is a medieval notion of subsistence.</p> <p>In order to enable a multiplication of wealthy individuals and not only a multiplication of wealth, we must think of a system that allows senior executives, according to a scale (Surn), to indirectly receive from their past efforts a substantial financial contribution, enabling new initiatives.</p> <p>Concretely, for a given commercial entity, it should pay a substantial contribution (Surnum\u00e9raire) into a special banking institution (SurnBank) for the benefit of its senior executives.

How to transcend all sociocultural, religious, and other differences and disparities? In fact, it suffices to accept the other in all his difference while keeping in mind the sole communion of interests. Each must accept the economic flourishing of the other, for it is the absolute condition of his own. Prosperity is for all on this earth or for none.</p> <p>Who has failed in this if not the developed nations that hoard everything and thus crystallize all resentments? The great must set the example of sharing. Otherwise, toward what outlets or economic partners will industrialized countries turn? Their selfishness turns against their interests. Even political dialogue or correlation of societies becomes impossible. Intolerance and confrontation between nations arise.</p> <p>The multiple resentments and frictions, intra\u2011national or international, are explained by a narrow economic horizon for many nations, societies, and individuals. To pacify is to let live and live decently.</p> <p>And yet, wealth in the world continues to grow. It ends up in the hands of the rich or of States without benefiting the social mass. It is important to establish a system more capable of distributing the wealth generated. Innovative criteria must be found to achieve social balance: namely, how to draw from the rich for the benefit of the poor without major resentments? We must find intermediary agents who will bridge the two worlds. Hence the idea of favoring senior executives of companies to allow them, within an acceptable time frame, to transform into new entrepreneurs generating employment for the benefit of the masses.</p> <p>Instead of companies being drained by state systems, a financial system will be set up for this intermediate class.
