# Chapter 4: The SurnBank – Architecture and Governance

## Introduction: An Institution for Equity

The SurnBank is the institutional pivot of Surnumerism. Its mission is to redistribute the funds of the CapitalSurn and to support the worker who has become an employer, fostering entrepreneurial continuity through satellite projects. <!-- Verification: Spelling corrected ("travaileur" → "travailleur"); Central focus: Levy for executives/strengthened entrepreneurial continuity. Suggestion: Planetary balance: Add global example, e.g., prototype in India for SurnBank in agro-industry, for diversity without regional focus -->

## Structure and Governance

- **National SurnBanks**: Interconnected through a global network under ECOSOC.  
- **Tripartite Council**: 30% businesses, 30% unions, 40% governments.  
- **Open-source AI**: Matching projects with executives, real-time audits. <!-- Verification: Spelling OK; Suggestion: Specify AI’s role in post-financing monitoring, e.g., cotton fiber factory in India, for planetary balance (Asia) and entrepreneurial follow-up -->

## Operations

Allocation:  
- **70%**: Productive projects (e.g., solar farm in Morocco).  
- **20%**: Continuing education (e.g., coding for 100,000 youth).  
- **10%**: Fundamental research (e.g., generic vaccines). <!-- Verification: Spelling corrected ("e génériques" → "génériques"); Central focus: Reinvestment for entrepreneurial continuity. Suggestion: Add example of global research, e.g., against malaria in Southeast Asia, for planetary balance -->

## Organization Chart and Administration

The SurnBank recruits executives like a multinational corporation.  
<!-- NOTE: Add an organization chart and international-style administration: e.g., CEO (senior executive), Board of Directors (global tripartite: companies like Siemens (Europe), banks like JPMorgan (USA), NGOs like UNDP), AI for automated audits. Use a simple diagram in Markdown or ASCII for visualization. Suggestion: Planetary balance: Include continental representatives (Asia, Europe, Americas) for hybrid governance -->

## Example: France (2035)

The French SurnBank redistributes 10 billion EUR, financing:  
- Hydrogen startups (+50,000 jobs).  
- Technical schools (SROI: 1.8). <!-- Verification: Spelling OK; Central focus: Projects for executives/continuity. Suggestion: Planetary balance: Add comparison with a SurnBank in Provence (rural France) vs prototype in Asia (e.g., India) for diversity -->

## Conclusion

The SurnBank embodies ethical governance, using the banking institution as a support to multiply labor and its subsidies, through entrepreneurial continuity of senior executives. The next chapter explores diversified financial contributions. <!-- Verification: Spelling corrected ("decupler" → "décupler", "subsides" → kept for philosophical tone); Redundancy removed; Central focus: Institution for executives/productive levy. Suggestion: Establish an international partnership between SurnBanks, with a Central Bank per continent (e.g., Asia via AIIB, Europe via ECB, Americas via FED, Africa via AfDB) for planetary balance -->
