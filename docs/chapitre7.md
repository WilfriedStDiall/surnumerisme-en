## Case: France

Integration with the CSG, financing green startups (+1% GDP), through monetary trust. <!-- NOTE: Details on tax exemption in France -->

## Case: China

Harmonization with Belt and Road, creating 2 million jobs, moralizing currency. <!-- NOTE: Add an African example, e.g., China-Nigeria partnership -->

## Conclusion
