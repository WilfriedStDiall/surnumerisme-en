# Chapter 9: Challenges and Criticisms – Responses to Skeptics

## Introduction: Anticipating Obstacles

Criticisms: complexity, resistance from elites, crypto volatility. Money, as a unit of account, guides the responses. <!-- NOTE: Add a specific criticism regarding African elites -->

## Responses

- **Complexity**: Simplified through AI and blockchain.  
- **Resistance**: Incentives (labels, exemptions).  
- **Volatility**: Reserve funds, anchored in monetary trust. <!-- NOTE: Example of crypto volatility in Nigeria -->

## Conclusion

Challenges are surmountable, using money as a lever. The next chapter is a universal call. <!-- NOTE: Refutation with an African example -->
