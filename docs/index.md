Welcome to SURNUMERISM, an open-source book on a LABOR-BASED economy.

Surnumerism highlights what is most precious in man:  
Man is an active actor in relation to his environment. He works.  
Others endure their environment and adapt to it.  
Man acts upon it, transforms it through his science and his effort.

The difference between man and animal is not only reflection but its usufruct: WORK.  
Possession matters little. To Produce, Reproduce, then Innovate is essential.  
It is work that gives value, and it must be the determining criterion among men.  
Work must be sought, valued, and remunerated.

IS THE SON OF MAN READY TO SHARE WORK AND NOT JUST TO MAKE OTHERS WORK?  
In ancient times there was SLAVERY. Today, the Salary is an EXPLOITATION of man by his fellow man.

We challenge the first of men and the first of so-called civilized nations  
to rise above the multitude still enslaved by a medieval mentality.

SURNUMERISM is like the proverb that masterfully exhorts us to learn  
to fish rather than to give fish to the needy.  
No new truth will spring from Surnumerism, but it is time for MAN to become wiser  
and to know that his best ally is none other than the HUMAN within himself.  
No entity, no machine, and no wealth can assist him as much as man himself  
in his journey toward full, balanced, and shared development.

WILFRIED ST DIAL is a pseudonym that reflects the date (October 12, 1492) of the discovery of the New World:  
A symbol for a new quest across the WORLD. This date is also the author’s birthday.  
His name is an English evocation of humanity’s dial and a statement of his patronym.

THIS IS A PERFECTIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO HUMANITY.  
IT IS A CALL FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL AND POLITICAL AWAKENING.
