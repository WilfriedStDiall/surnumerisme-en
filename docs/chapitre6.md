# Chapter 6: Risk Countermeasures – Supply-Demand Balance and Training

## Introduction: Anticipating Imbalances

Surnumerism manages risks (overproduction, elite capture) by using currency as a tool to support human labor. <!-- NOTE: Add a risk specific to Africa, e.g., commodity price volatility -->

## Solutions

- **Predictive AI**: Prevents excess supply by adjusting investments.  
- **Universal Training**: 20% of funds finance education (e.g., 500,000 learners in AI).  
- **Transparent Audits**: Blockchain for traceability, strengthening monetary trust. <!-- NOTE: Include an example of training in Africa, e.g., AI program in Kenya -->

## Example: China (2035)

The Chinese SurnBank finances robot factories, balanced by massive training programs, using currency as the unit of account. <!-- NOTE: Add an African example, e.g., supply-demand balance in Nigeria for oil -->

## Conclusion

Countermeasures ensure stability, anchored in currency. The next chapter explores national application. <!-- NOTE: Transition toward an African pilot -->
